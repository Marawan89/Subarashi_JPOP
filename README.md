## The Project
<p>
  As said before in this project you can view the list of the top anime and manga, this list gets update using the MyAnimeList rating so it's pretty accurate. You can add your favourite anime and manga by clicking the + botton and can view your favourite list in the favourite page.

## Getting Started
If this is your first time installing the application you will need to connect to internt or you will not view anything (the list of the anime/manga needs internet but the favourite list can be viewed without internet).
After that you will select the category you want (AnimeWorld or MangaWorl)
