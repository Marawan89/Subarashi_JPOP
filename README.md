<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## The Project
<p>
  As said before in this project you can view the list of the top anime and manga, this list gets update using the MyAnimeList rating so it's pretty accurate. You can add your favourite anime and manga by clicking the + botton and can view your favourite list in the favourite page.
</p>

<p>The technologies used in this project are LiveData, RecyclerView, ViewModel, Repositories, RoomDatabase, Dao, Entities and dialogs</p>
